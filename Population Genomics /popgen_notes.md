09/10/2024: intro to Centaurea GBS data and working with VCF files

We'll be analyzing the GBS data from three regions (EU, NE, and PNW) starting today with variant call format files (VCFs)

Data was viewed in the command line in a fastq file. The letters represented the Q scores of the data (I was 1 in 10,000 Bp that there is an error), showed accurate data

cd: change directory

ls -l: long list (can be abbreviated as ll)

zcat: View a zip file

| : "pipe" send the output of one function to another

Head: view the first 10 lines of code

CCACA: bar code for that specific sequence

If you are in the correct directory with a specific file or directory you can use TAB to auto complete the file name or directory
